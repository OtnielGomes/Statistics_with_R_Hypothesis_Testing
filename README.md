# My learning with Statistics using the R language: Hypotheses and Tests
Project with hypothesis testing, known as normality testing, so we can quickly visualize why tests are being carried out and where we want to go with this.

Then we will have the steps of a test, the formulation of hypotheses, the ways of identifying areas of rejection and acceptance of the test hypotheses, calculation of comparison statistics, and all these details that involve hypothesis testing on a set of data taken from the IBGE National Household Sample Survey - 2015.

Project dataset
National Household Sample Survey - 2015 in Brazil
The National Household Sample Survey - PNAD investigates annually, on a permanent basis, general characteristics of the population, education, work, income and housing and others, with variable frequency, according to the country's information needs, such as characteristics about migration, fertility, nuptiality, health, food security, among other topics. The survey of these statistics constitutes, over 49 years of research, an important instrument for formulating, validating and evaluating policies aimed at socioeconomic development and improving living conditions in Brazil.
